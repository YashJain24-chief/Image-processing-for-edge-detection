# Image-processing-for-edge-detection
Implementation of Convolutional Neural Network(CNN) techniques for edge detection

In here, the image is being processed for the detection of edges. The image gets processed through various layers of the model. First layer being the convolution layer, second layer being the 'Relu' unit and last layer being the pooling layer. AveragePooling operation is being used for better accuracy of the model.
